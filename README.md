# Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry PHP

The Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry PHP (EDOT PHP) is a customized version of [OpenTelemetry for PHP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/php).

EDOT PHP makes it easier to get started using OpenTelemetry in your PHP applications through strictly OpenTelemetry-native means, while also providing a smooth and rich out-of-the-box experience with [Elastic Observability](https://www.elastic.co/observability). It's an explicit goal of this distribution to introduce **no new concepts** beyond those defined by the wider OpenTelemetry community.

With EDOT PHP, you get all the features of the OpenTelemetry PHP agent, plus:

- SDK improvements and bug fixes contributed by the Elastic team _before_ they are available upstream in OpenTelemetry repositories.
- Optional features that enhance OpenTelemetry data sent to Elastic.
- Preconfigured collection of tracing signals
- The OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) exporter enabled out of the box.
